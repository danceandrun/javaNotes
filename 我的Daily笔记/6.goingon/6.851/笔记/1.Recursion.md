# 递归

递归和循环一样是程序流程控制的一种，在分治思想解决问题时，常使用递归的写法。因为递归内容很丰富，经常遇到新的问题和困惑但是有趣的解法，希望能系统掌握递归，所以这里对我在工作学习时遇到的和递归相关的问题进行总结

## 时间复杂度分析

科学全面的分析方法在《Introduction to Algorithms(Fourth Edition)》这本书的第4章讨论分治算法的时候提到过，摘抄如下：

> We want simple-to-use tools that can handle the most commonly occurring situations. But we also want general tools that work, perhaps with a little more effort, for less common cases. This chapter offers four methods for solving recurrences:
>
> - In the **substitution method** (Section 4.3), you guess the form of a bound and then use mathematical induction to prove your guess correct and solve for constants. This method is perhaps the most robust method for solving recurrences, but it also requires you to make a good guess and to produce an inductive proof.
>   
> - The **recursion-tree method** (Section 4.4) models the recurrence as a tree whose nodes represent the costs incurred at various levels of the recursion. To solve the recurrence, you determine the costs at each level and add them up, perhaps using techniques for bounding summations from Section A.2. Even if you don’t use this method to formally prove a bound, it can be helpful in guessing the form of the bound for use in the substitution method.
>   
> - The **master method** (Sections 4.5 and 4.6) is the easiest method, when it applies. It provides bounds for recurrences of the form T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n), where a > 0 and b > 1 are constants and f(n) is a given “driving”
>   function. This type of recurrence tends to arise more frequently in the study of algorithms than any other. It characterizes a divide-and-conquer algorithm that creates a subproblems, each of which is 1/b times the size of the original problem, using f(n) time for the divide and combine steps. To apply the master method, you need to memorize three cases, but once you do, you can easily determine asymptotic bounds on running times for many divide-and-conquer algorithms.
>   
> - The **Akra-Bazzi method** (Section 4.7) is a general method for solving divide-and-conquer recurrences. Although it involves calculus, it can be used to attack more complicated recurrences than those addressed by the master method.
